## Active Experiments

- `agent.selection.simulate` (Decision Simulator): Deterministic scoring + sensitivity to model what an agent would choose from structured signals.

## Parked Ideas

- Agent Surface Generator (Wix-lite, no hosting): Generate an `api/agent` + `api/context` surface for a site from a config file; monetization hypothesis: paid setup + ongoing maintenance; next action: draft a minimal config schema and CLI skeleton; last_updated: 2026-02-15.
- Agent Readiness Score / Leaderboard: Publish a scoreboard for audited/verified sites based on evidence; monetization hypothesis: verification services + sponsored boosts (disclosed); next action: define a stable scoring rubric and anti-gaming rules; last_updated: 2026-02-15.
